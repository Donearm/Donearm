### Hi there, I am Gianluca Fiore (aka Donearm, aka The Fountain Pen Creator and more)

Lots of names for a single person! I have been self-teaching myself programming and system administration for about 20 years, with no end of the learning in sight.

I am a **Python/Go** programmer, **Linux** administrator and FOSS enthusiast, **DevOps** Engineer and, nowadays, **Technical/Content Writer**. I am an enthusiast about learning new concepts, documenting them, and raising awareness on the issues our world faces. Creating useful documentation and making it simpler to understand hard concepts is a **pleasure** for me, before being my job.

### What I do in my spare time

Usually you can find me with my nose in a book (or, more recently, in my e-book reader). I read whenever possible, with a strong passion being fantasy literature (how original for a programmer eh?), history, philosophy, mythology, languages and the classics (from Gilgamesh to Dostoevsky). The general plan being reading at least 1000 books before I die (keeping track on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/25653929-gianluca-fiore?ref=nav_mybooks)).

Outside of reading, I write for myself (travelling and coffee being two big passions), I watch lots of football, occasionally movies, and update [my knowledge wiki](https://www.gianlucafiore.it/Personal-Wiki/).
