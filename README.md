### Hi there, I am Gianluca Fiore (aka Donearm, aka The Fountain Pen Creator and more)

Lots of names for a single person! I have been self-teaching myself programming and system administration for about 20 years, with no end of the learning in sight.

I am a Python/Go programmer, Linux "expert", System Administrator, DevOps Engineer and, nowadays, Technical/Content Writer. I am an enthusiast about learning new concepts, documenting them, and raising awareness of the issues our world faces.
